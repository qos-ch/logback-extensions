/**
 * A Logback {@code Appender} implementation which delegates the actual appending to a named bean contained in a Spring
 * {@code ApplicationContext}.
 * <p/>
 * This appender is similar in spirit to Spring's {@code DelegatingFilterProxy}, which allows servlet filters to be
 * created and wired in the ApplicationContext and then accessed in the filter chain. As with the filter proxy, the
 * delegating appender uses its own name to find the target appender in the context.
 * <p/>
 * Because the logging framework is usually started before the Spring context, this appender supports caching for
 * {@code ILoggingEvent}s which are received before the {@code ApplicationContext} is available. This caching has
 * 3 possible modes:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>off</b> - Events are discarded until the {@code ApplicationContext} is available.</li>
 * <li><b>on</b> - Events are cached with strong references until the {@code ApplicationContext} is available, at
 * which time they will be forwarded to the delegate appender. In systems which produce substantial amounts of log
 * events while starting up the {@code ApplicationContext} this mode may result in heavy memory usage.</li>
 * <li><b>soft</b> - Events are wrapped in {@code SoftReference}s and cached until the {@code ApplicationContext}
 * is available. Memory pressure may cause the garbage collector to collect some or all of the cached events before
 * the {@code ApplicationContext} is available, so some or all events may be lost. However, in systems with heavy
 * logging, this mode may result in more efficient memory usage.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Caching is <b>{@code on}</b> by default, so strong references will be used for all events.
 * <p/>
 * An example of how to use this appender in {@code logback.xml}:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;appender name="<em>appenderBeanName</em>" class="ch.qos.logback.ext.spring.DelegatingLogbackAppender"/&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Or, if specifying a different cache mode, e.g.:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;appender name="<em>appenderBeanName</em>" class="ch.qos.logback.ext.spring.DelegatingLogbackAppender"&gt;
 *     &lt;cacheMode&gt;soft&lt;/cacheMode&gt;
 * &lt;/appender&gt;
 * </pre>
 * Using this appender requires that the {@link ApplicationContextHolder} be included in the {@code ApplicationContext}.
